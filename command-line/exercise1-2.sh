# Write a command that prints out the string “hello, world”. Extra credit: As in Listing 1, do it two different ways, both with and without using quotation marks.
echo hello world
echo '"hello world"'

# Type the command echo ’hello (with a mismatched single quote), and then get out of trouble using the technique from Box 4.
echo 'hello
