# Using echo and >, make files called line_1.txt and line_2.txt containing the first and second lines of Sonnet 1, respectively.
echo "From the fairest creature we desire increase" > line_1.txt
echo "That thereby beauty's Rose might never die" > line_2.txt

# Replicate the original sonnet_1.txt (containing the first two lines of the sonnet) by first redirecting the contents of line_1.txt and then appending the contents of line_2.txt. Call the new file sonnet_1_copy.txt, and confirm using diff that itâ€™s identical to sonnet_1.txt. Hint: When there is no diff between two files, diff simply outputs nothing.
cat line_1.txt > sonnet_1_copy.txt
cat line_2.txt >> sonnet_1_copy.txt
diff sonnet_1.txt sonnet_1_copy.txt

# Use cat to combine the contents of line_1.txt and line_2.txt in reverse order using a single command, yielding the file sonnet_1_reversed.txt. Hint: The cat command can take multiple arguments.
cat line_2.txt line_1.txt > sonnet_1_reversed.txt
